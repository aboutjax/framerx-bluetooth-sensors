# FramerX Bluetooth Sensors

This is an experiment for pairing bluetooth sensors with FramerX prototypes. The sensors used (not limited) are:

- Wahoo TICKRX Heart Rate Monitor
- Wahoo KICKR Smart Indoor Trainer

# Objective

1. Learn about the [web bluetooth API](https://webbluetoothcg.github.io/web-bluetooth/)
3. Learn about React Hooks and use [ReactN](https://github.com/CharlesStover/reactn) to manage the stream of data from sensors as global states.
4. Make each code component listen to global states and render data accordingly.
